# Multi-Factor_Modeling
Multi-Factor Modeling with Technical Indictors: Anlysis of the relationship between technical indicators and equity risk premium.

Objective: analyze the effectiveness of technical indicators to identify excess returns. Historical prices will be used to generate common indicators and for each indicator, they are evaluated using the Fama-French model.

Calculations generated by TA-Lib, documentation: https://cryptotrader.org/talib


# Usage
Provided a *ticker* and *period (1mo, 1y, 3y, max, etc.)*

```df = get_historical_prices(*ticker,*period)```

## To display buy and sell signals given the indicator
### BollingerBands
Disply the price and buy/sell signals:
```BollingerBands()```
Display the indicator graph:
```Plot_BollingerBands_indicator()```

### MACD
```MACD()```

### RSI
```RSI()```

# Fama French 3-Factor Model

($$\R_{it} - RF_{ft} )= a_i + b_i (Mkt-RF) + s_iSMB + h_iHML + e_i$$

Where:



*   $R_i$ is the daily return of the porfolio
*   $RF_t$ is the risk free rate


*   $Mkt-RF$ is the return spread between the capitalization weighted stock market and cash
*   $SMB$ is the return spread of small minus large stocks (i.e. the size effect)


*   $HML$ is the return spread of cheap minus expensive stocks (i.e. the value effect)


**Extension to the FF model:**

($R_i - RF_t )= a_i + b_i (Mkt-RF) + s_iSMB + h_iHML + g_i Indicator + e_i$



*   Adding the sudo-variable, $Indicator$ which is 0 for short and 1 for long or hold

*   The logarithmic risk-free returns $(R_{it}-R_{ft})$ are used as the independent variable and calculated as follows:


$(R_{it}-R_{ft}) = ln((ClosingPrice_{t} - ClosingPrice_{t-1}) - RF_t)$
